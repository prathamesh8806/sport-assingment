            Kabaddi is basically a combative sport, with seven players on each side;
             played for a period of 40 minutes with a 5 minutes break (20-5-20). 
        </li>

        <li>
            The core idea of the game is to score points by raiding into the opponent's court and touching as many defense players as possible without getting caught on a single breath.
